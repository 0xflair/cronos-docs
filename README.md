# Getting Started

Thanks for your interest in Cronos Chain. In this technical documentation, we cover e.g.:

* For users, wallet setup and bridging solutions
* For DApp devs, chain integration, smart contract deployment and Cronos Play modules
* For node hosts, node setup instructions and our all-in-one command-line interface `cronosd`

### What is Cronos Chain?

Cronos is the first Ethereum-compatible blockchain network built on Cosmos SDK technology. An open-source and permission-less Layer 1 chain, Cronos aims to massively scale the DeFi, GameFi, and overall Web3 user community by providing builders with the ability to instantly port apps and crypto assets from other chains while benefiting from low transaction fees, high throughput, and fast finality.
