# Getting Started

Thanks for your interest in Cronos. In this technical documentation, we cover the following:

* For users, wallet setup and bridging solutions
* For DApp developers, chain integration, smart contract deployment and Cronos Play modules
* For node hosts, node setup instructions and our all-in-one command-line interface `cronosd`

### What is Cronos?

Cronos is the first Ethereum-compatible blockchain network built on Cosmos SDK technology. It is an open-source and permission-less layer-1 network that aims to massively scale the DeFi, GameFi, and overall Web3 user community. Cronos does this by providing builders with the ability to instantly port DApps and crypto assets from other chains with low transaction fees, high throughput, and fast finality.
