* #### Creating API Keys on CronoScan

The CronoScan Developer APIs are designed to provide accessible and consistent Cronos data to the Cronos community. The APIs are provided as a community service with a rate up to 5 calls per second per IP. Users need to [register](https://cronoscan.com/register) for a CronoScan account to create an API key. After registration, a CronoScan user account will have a quota of up to 3 API keys.

On the [CronoScan user dashboard](https://cronoscan.com/myaccount), select “_**API-KEYs**_” from the left-hand side column or go to [https://cronoscan.com/myapikey](https://cronoscan.com/myapikey).

Click on the “_**Create a new API-KEY token**_” button, then optionally input an “_**AppName**_”, “My Cronos App” for example.

After the “_**API-KEY Token**_” is successfully created, a message will show up as below, and you may now use the “_**API key token**_” for your applications on Cronos!
