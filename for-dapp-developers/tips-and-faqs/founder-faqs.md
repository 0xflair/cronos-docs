## FAQs - ecosystem

**How can I get my project listed at** [**cronos.org/ecosystem**](http://cronos.org/ecosystem)**?**

* Visit [https://cronos.org/ecosystem](https://cronos.org/ecosystem) where you can add your project to the list of Cronos ecosystem projects (click the Submit button).

**How can I get my project featured in the Crypto.com Defi Wallet in-app browser, once deployed on Cronos?**

* Step 1:
  * The first step is to implement login via the Crypto .com Defi Wallet’s SDK, using the DeFiWeb3Connector.
  * See [this tutorial](https://medium.com/cronos-chain/cronos-developer-series-connect-your-dapp-with-defi-wallet-metamask-and-trust-wallet-77419fe696a5) on how to implement wallet connections. For the purpose of the DeFi wallet, if you are using ReactJS, you need to implement the DeFiWeb3Connector as shown in this [illustrative code repository provided with the tutorial](https://github.com/kentimsit/cronos-wallet-connections/blob/main/src/helpers/wallet-defiwallet.ts).
  * For more details, you can refer to this repository for documentation and usage: [https://github.com/crypto-com/deficonnect-monorepo/tree/develop/packages/web3-connector](https://github.com/crypto-com/deficonnect-monorepo/tree/develop/packages/web3-connector).
  * You cannot proceed to Step 2 until you have checked that your dApp offers a functional connection to the Crypto com DeFi Wallet’s Browser Extension in a desktop browser ([here is the link to the browser extension in the Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptocom-wallet-extensio/hifafgmccdpekplomjjkcfgodnhcellj)).
* Step 2:
  * Complete [this form](https://crypto-com.typeform.com/to/bRvudlYV) to apply to get the URL of your dApp featured in the DeFi Wallet’s dApp ranking tab.
  * The Crypto .com team may need some time to assess the suitability of your dApp and does not provide updates regarding their internal decision making process until there is a positive decision (if any). They may revisit their decisions occasionally, for example a token sale page may not be featured in the Dapp ranking but it may be featured later, once it includes a Dapp with real utility for end-users.
  * Decision criteria include the transparency and security of the dApp, and the quality of the user experience. Therefore, in order to increase your chances of being approved, please ensure that your user-facing website includes a link to your docs and to your Github repository, and that the docs include links to the verified smart contracts on Cronoscan. You can refer to [this tutorial](https://medium.com/cronos-chain/cronos-developer-series-deploy-verify-your-contracts-using-hardhat-8b6ab6928986) on how to verify your smart contracts on Cronoscan. Also, you can refer to [this example of docs](https://docs.vvs.finance/) for a best practice.
* Note: There is currently no process in place to request a token integration with the Crypto.com DeFi Wallet. Token integrations happen once in a while. Meanwhile, your users can import your token manually. See this [Crypto.com help page](https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/5755942-tokens-import) for more information.

**How can I get my project featured in Trust Wallet, once deployed on Cronos?**

* [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/) supports the Cronos mainnet from within the in-app Dapp browser (via the injected Web3 provider) and also via Wallet Connect.
* You can contact the Trust Wallet team to have your Dapp and/or token featured in the Trust Wallet’s mobile Dapp browser. Refer to the [documentation](https://developer.trustwallet.com/listing-guide) for more details.

**How can I get my NFT collection allow-listed on the relevant NFT platforms?**

* Crypto.com NFT platform
  * Crypto.com NFT platform is a custodial platform that supports Cronos and multiple other chains.
  * New launch: if you want to create and sell a new NFT collection on the custodial Crypto .com / NFT platform, please contact Crypto .com directly (see this [link](https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/5588880-nft-creation)).
  * Secondary trading: if you already have a NFT collection live on the Cronos chain and would like to make it allow-listed on the custodial Crypto .com / NFT platform so that the NFT owners can deposit and trade the NFTs at Crypto .com / NFT, please contact Cronos Labs for support ([contact@cronoslabs.org](mailto:contact@cronoslabs.org)) and we will share with you the contractual documents and proof of ownership requirements that are required by Crypto .com.
* Minted NFT platform
  * Minted is a self-custodial NFT platform on Cronos chain and on Ethereum.
  * New launch & secondary trading: the Cronos Labs team can put you in touch with the Minted team via Telegram. Please create a telegram group \[Your project] <> Minted and send the link to your Cronos Labs contact.
