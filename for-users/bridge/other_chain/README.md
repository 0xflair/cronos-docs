# From Crypto.org Chain

## Introduction

![centered image](../assets/webappintro.png)

The Cronos bridge’s goal is to support a seamless transfer of assets between blockchains to foster interoperability and for users to enjoy the best Dapps and earnings no matter the chain.

The Cronos Bridge (Beta) can be found at [https://cronos.org/bridge](https://cronos.org/bridge)

Our bridge is a fully decentralized protocol built on the open-source projects of [IBC](https://ibcprotocol.org/) and [Gravity Bridge](https://github.com/cosmos/gravity-bridge).

Please read the guide carefully and review the project documentation as misuse may cause incorrect transfer or even loss of assets. We recommend transferring a small amount first to get yourself acquainted with the bridge before moving significant amounts.
