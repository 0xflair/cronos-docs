# ðŸ”¥ Crypto Wallets

Cronos is supported by more than 30 wallets, some of which are shown [here](https://cronos.org/wallets).&#x20;

## Crypto.com DeFi Wallet

The [Crypto.com DeFi Wallet](https://crypto.com/defi-wallet) is a self-custodial crypto wallet developed by Crypto.com. It supports Cronos and dozens of Cronos cryptocurrencies natively, as well as all NFTs on the Cronos chain. The wallet is available in 3 user interfaces:

* The mobile wallet, available for iOS and Android (download [here](https://crypto.com/fr/defi-wallet)). The mobile app includes a powerful in-app browser to interact with decentralized applications (DeFi, NFTs and Web3 Gaming).
* The browser extension, available from the Chrome store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptocom-wallet-extensio/hifafgmccdpekplomjjkcfgodnhcellj). The browser extension can run in two possible modes: in Standalone mode (meaning that you can approve transactions in the browser) or in Bridge mode (meaning that the extension is connected to the mobile app, where you approve transactions). We recommend Standalone mode for best performance and richest functionalities.
* The desktop wallet (download [here](https://crypto.com/fr/defi-wallet)), which can run as a standalone application on your computer.

The DeFi Wallet is not just for DeFi. One unique feature of the Crypto.com DeFi Wallet mobile app is the NFT tab, where you can see, transfer, buy and sell all your self-custodial NFTs on Cronos chain.

You can import your accounts from any other self-custodial crypto wallet into the Crypto.com DeFi Wallet by importing your seed phrase under "Import wallet".

In order to experience the fullest range of functionalities, including interactions with dApps, we recommend to connect your Ledger hardware wallet with the Crypto.com DeFi browser extension in Standalone mode. In order to accomplish this, select "Import wallet" in the Crypto.com DeFi browser extension and then select "Connect to Ledger".
