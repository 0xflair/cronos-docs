# Introduction

## Cronos

Crypto.org introduced the Cronos Mainnet Beta, a Cosmos SDK-based EVM compatible chain, on 8 Nov 2021.

Cronos is a EVM-compatible chain running in parallel with the [Crypto.org Chain](https://crypto.org/docs/). It aims to massively scale the Crypto.org Chain DeFi ecosystem by providing developers with the ability to rapidly port DApps from Ethereum and EVM-Compatible chains. Developers also gain access to the massive user base of the Crypto.com ecosystem and funding from Cronos Ecosystem Grants.

### Cronos on Ethermint

Cronos is powered by [Ethermint](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint), which allows for the rapid porting of DApps smart contracts from Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains. Cronos's base settlement currency will be CRO, the native currency of the Crypto.org Chain. The Inter Blockchain Communications (IBC) protocol enables interoperability and bridging to the Crypto.org Chain, a fully decentralised, open-source, energy efficient public chain with high speed and extremely low fees. It also allows interoperating with other IBC-enabled chains like Cosmos Hub.

### Cronos Ecosystem Grants

The Cronos Ecosystem Grants programme aims to support early-stage projects on Cronos by bootstrapping initial product development and providing technical support. We aim to align incentives with new builders and teams by helping their projects grow together with the broader ecosystem. We welcome any talented individuals and teams who are passionate and committed to building incredible products within the Cronos ecosystem. Interested parties can visit the [Cronos grants page](https://cronos.org/grants) and [Cronos's Medium page](https://medium.com/cronos-chain) to learn more about this programme and receive all the latest updates.

### Features of Cronos

#### **EVM-Compatible**

Ethereum developers are used to smart contract capabilities as Ethermint can support any smart contracts, DAOs or Dapps deployed on Ethereum.

#### **Scalable**&#x20;

Tendermint can process a higher number of transactions per minute as compared to EVM, making it faster, cheaper, and carbon-neutral to execute smart contracts.

#### **Interoperable**

IBC is a protocol that allows blockchains to communicate with each other, interoperate and transfer value, interchange assets and services, and connect without running into the scaling issues inherent in some of the largest blockchains today.

#### **Easy Deployment**&#x20;

Users can follow the deployment instructions to quickly and easily deploy to the Cronos network for their own usage purposes.

#### **Crypto.com ecosystem**&#x20;

Gain access to an ecosystem of over 50 million users.

#### **Crypto.com Community Support**

Enjoy strong support from the community, including contribution to open-source projects and security reviews.
